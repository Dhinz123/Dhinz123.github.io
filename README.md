# **The Future of Medical Genetics and the Importance of Digital Health**

When one talks about genetic medicine; this sounds like it is something out of science fiction. But as today, we can do all these bizarre things. Maybe not everything out of the movies, but a fraction of it. Now the idea of medical genetics is that we apply [the genetic principles](https://www.ashg.org/discover-genetics/medical-genetics/#:~:text=Medical%20genetics%20is%20any%20application)  to medical practice, which includes studies of inheritance, mapping disease genes, diagnosis and treatment, and genetic counselling. Apart from that, how is this tied to digital health, and what the future holds in the world of medicine for us? 

## **How does this work?**

This is done by genetic engineering through the usage of a process of recombinant DNA technology called CRISPR by altering the genetic makeup of an organism. [Recombinant DNA technology](https://youthmedicaljournal.org/2021/03/21/the-future-of-genetic-engineering/) utilises enzymes in a lab to manipulate the DNA of interest; a gene of interest from an organism is integrated into another organism such as bacteria or yeasts as a host. This then creates a recombinant DNA from 2 species, the combining process is called DNA splicing. The resulting hosting organism will replicate the DNA with its own, producing the desired protein. An example of this is the production of insulin to treat diabetes.
